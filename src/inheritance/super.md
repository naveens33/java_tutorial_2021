**The `super` Keyword in Java:**

The `super` keyword in Java is used to refer to the superclass or parent class of the current subclass. It is often used to access or invoke members (fields and methods) of the superclass. The `super` keyword plays a significant role in constructor chaining, method overriding, and accessing hidden fields.

**1. Accessing Superclass Members:**
- The `super` keyword is used to access members of the superclass from within the subclass.
- It can be used to access both fields and methods of the superclass.
- When used with a field, it refers to the field of the superclass.

Example:
```java
class Animal {
    String name = "Animal";
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String name = "Dog";
    
    void display() {
        System.out.println(name);        // Refers to 'Dog' from subclass
        System.out.println(super.name);  // Refers to 'Animal' from superclass
    }
}
```

**2. Invoking Superclass Constructors:**
- The `super()` constructor call is used to invoke the constructor of the superclass.
- It should be the first statement in the subclass constructor.
- It is useful when you want to perform some common initialization that exists in the superclass's constructor.

Example:
```java
class Animal {
    Animal(String type) {
        System.out.println("An " + type + " is created.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
        super("animal");  // Invokes the constructor of Animal
    }
}
```

**3. Method Overriding and `super`:**
- When a method is overridden in the subclass, the `super` keyword can be used to explicitly call the overridden method of the superclass.
- This is useful when you want to extend the functionality of the overridden method rather than replace it entirely.

Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        super.makeSound();  // Calls the makeSound method of Animal
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}
```

**4. Hidden Fields and `super`:**
- If a subclass defines a field with the same name as a field in the superclass, the field in the subclass "hides" the field in the superclass.
- The `super` keyword can be used to access the hidden field of the superclass.

Example:
```java
class Animal {
    String name = "Animal";
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String name = "Dog";
    
    void displayNames() {
        System.out.println(name);        // Refers to 'Dog' from subclass
        System.out.println(super.name);  // Refers to 'Animal' from superclass
    }
}
```

The `super` keyword is a powerful tool for managing relationships between superclasses and subclasses. It helps in invoking constructors, accessing hidden members, and facilitating method overriding while providing a clear way to differentiate between superclass and subclass members.
