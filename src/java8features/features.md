Java 8 introduced several significant features and enhancements to the Java programming language. Some of the key features of Java 8 are:

1. **Lambda Expressions**: Lambda expressions allow you to define inline, lightweight functions or blocks of code. They simplify the syntax for writing functional interfaces (single abstract method interfaces) and make it easier to work with collections and streams.

2. **Functional Interfaces**: Java 8 introduced the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation and a set of predefined functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, such as `Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, and `Supplier`.

3. **Streams**: Streams are a new abstraction that allows you to process sequences of data in a functional style. You can use streams to perform operations like `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, and `collect` on collections, making code more concise and readable.

4. **Default Methods**: Default methods enable you to add new methods to existing interfaces without breaking the implementations of classes that already use those interfaces. This helps with backward compatibility when evolving APIs.

5. **Method References**: Method references provide a shorthand notation for invoking a method by referring to it with the help of the `::` operator. They are especially useful when working with lambdas.

6. **Optional**: The `Optional` class was introduced to handle situations where a method might return a non-null value or nothing at all. It encourages a more explicit and safe approach to handling null values.

7. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**: Java 8 included the Nashorn JavaScript engine for improved JavaScript support within Java applications. It provides a way to execute JavaScript code from Java and interact with JavaScript objects.

8. **New Date and Time API**: The `java.time` package introduces a modern, comprehensive date and time API, including classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`, and more. It addresses many of the limitations of the old `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes.

9. **Parallel Streams**: Java 8 introduced parallel processing support for streams, allowing you to take advantage of multi-core processors for more efficient data processing.

10. **CompletableFuture**: The `CompletableFuture` class provides a way to work with asynchronous tasks and handle future values. It simplifies asynchronous programming and enables better control over concurrency.

11. **New Functional Constructs**: Java 8 introduced several functional programming constructs like `reduce`, `forEach`, and `collect` methods on collections, which make it easier to work with data in a functional way.

12. **Type Annotations**: Type annotations, represented by `@Repeatable` and `@Target` annotations, allow you to apply annotations to types, not just declarations.

These features have significantly enhanced the expressiveness, readability, and maintainability of Java code, making Java 8 a major milestone in the evolution of the Java programming language.
