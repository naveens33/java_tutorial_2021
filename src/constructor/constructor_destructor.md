There are constructors and destructors, but they work slightly differently compared to some other programming languages. Let me explain:

**Constructors:**
- A constructor in Java is a special type of method that is automatically called when an object is created using the `new` keyword.
- Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type, not even `void`.
- Constructors can have parameters, allowing you to initialize instance variables during object creation.
- If you don't provide a constructor, Java provides a default constructor with no parameters.
- You can have multiple constructors by using constructor overloading.

Example of a constructor in Java:
```java
public class MyClass {
    private int value;

    public MyClass(int val) {
        value = val;
    }
}
```

**Destructors:**
In Java, there is no equivalent of destructors as found in languages like C++. Java has automatic memory management using the garbage collector, which takes care of deallocating memory when objects are no longer reachable. Developers don't need to explicitly destroy objects like they do with destructors in languages that don't have garbage collection.

**Garbage Collection:**
Java uses a garbage collector to automatically reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable. Objects that are no longer referenced are identified by the garbage collector and are eventually cleaned up. This makes memory management easier and helps prevent memory leaks.

In summary, while Java doesn't have explicit destructors, the garbage collector handles memory management automatically, allowing developers to focus on object creation and manipulation using constructors and other methods.
