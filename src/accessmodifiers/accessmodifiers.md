Sure, here are some notes on access modifiers in Java:

Access modifiers in Java are keywords that determine the visibility and accessibility of classes, fields, methods, and other members within a class or package.

There are four main access modifiers in Java:

1. **public**: Members marked as `public` are accessible from any class and package. They have the widest visibility and can be accessed by any code that can see the containing class.

2. **private**: Members marked as `private` are only accessible within the same class. They are not visible to other classes or packages. This provides encapsulation and helps in hiding implementation details.

3. **protected**: Members marked as `protected` are accessible within the same class, same package, and subclasses (even if they are in different packages). This modifier is useful for providing controlled access to certain members while preventing unrestricted access from external classes.

4. **default (no modifier)**: Members without an access modifier (also known as package-private or package access) are accessible only within the same package. They are not accessible outside the package, even to subclasses in other packages.

Here's a summary of their visibility:

| Modifier    | Same Class | Same Package | Subclass (Same/Different Package) | Other Classes (Same/Different Package) |
|-------------|------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| public      | Yes        | Yes          | Yes                               | Yes                                  |
| protected   | Yes        | Yes          | Yes/Yes                           | No/No                                |
| default     | Yes        | Yes          | No/No                             | No/No                                |
| private     | Yes        | No           | No/No                             | No/No                                |

Note:
- A subclass in a different package can access `protected` members only through inheritance, not through an instance of the superclass.
- The `default` modifier is the absence of an explicit access modifier. If no access modifier is specified, the member will have package access.

Remember that access modifiers are crucial for controlling the level of encapsulation and data hiding in your Java programs. By choosing the appropriate access modifier, you can design classes and interfaces that provide a clear and secure interface for interacting with your code.
